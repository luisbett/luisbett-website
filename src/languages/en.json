    "aboutMeText": "I was born in Joinville, Santa Catarina, Brazil, and currently reside in Mullingar, Ireland. I am passionate about technology, sports, and music. My journey into software development began in high school, where I attended a technical vocational training course alongside my regular education. After high school, I pursued a degree in Analysis and Systems Development at the university. During my university years, I secured my first job as a software developer at NG Informática. After five years of valuable experience, I made the decision to move to Dublin, Ireland, to further my studies and enhance my English skills. Within 1 year and 6 months, I had the opportunity to join Writech Group, and I relocated to Mullingar. Since then, I have been dedicated to continuous learning in web development, exploring technologies such as React, React Native, Vue JS, and Node JS.",
