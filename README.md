## About

This was my first web project built using Vue.js, and the objective was to study and familiarize myself with web development and also, create a portfolio where I could share my projects, personal information and contact details.

For the emails workflow from the contact form to my personal email I chose the EmailJS service. For responsiveness of most of components I chose the flexbox layout model.

Also, in this project I used two packages:

* [**i18n**](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/) for internationalization, so the website can be read in more than one language;
* [**tabler**](https://tabler.io/docs/icons/vue) for the icons in the project;

I learned a lot about the Vue.js infrastructure, such as how to use routers and how to create my own plugin to contain the global methods of my website. Likewise, I chose Netlify to deployment and hosting and I could learn more about these processes.
